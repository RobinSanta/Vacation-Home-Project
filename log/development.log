Temperatures vary greatly from place to place, season to season, and day to night. Average daily temperatures at Yuma, in the southwestern desert range from 43Â° to 67Â°F (6Â° to 19Â°C) in January, and from 81Â° to 106Â°F (27Â° to 41Â°C) in July. At Flagstaff, in the interior uplands, average daily January temperatures range from 14Â° to 41Â°F (â€“10Â° to 5Â°C), and average daily July temperatures range from 50Â° to 81Â°F (10Â° to 27Â°C). The maximum recorded temperature was 128Â°F (53Â°C), registered at Lake Havasu City on 29 June 1994; the minimum, â€“40Â°F (â€“40Â°C), was set at Hawley Lake on 7 January 1971. The highest elevations of the state, running diagonally from the southeast to the northwest, receive between 25 and 30 in (63 to 76 cm) of precipitation a year, and the rest, for the most part, between 7 and 20 in (18 to 51 cm). Average annual precipitation at Phoenix (1971â€“2000) was 8.3 in (21 cm). The driest area is the extreme southwest, which receives less than 3 in (8 cm) a year. Snow, sometimes as much as 100 in (254 cm), falls on the highest peaks each winter but is rare in the southern and western lowlands. The greatest amount of sunshine is registered in the southwest, with the proportion decreasing progressively toward the northeast; overall, the state receives more than 80% of possible sunshine, among the highest in the US, and Phoenix's 86% is higher than that of any other major US city."], ["created_at", "2020-01-02 19:46:24.220099"], ["updated_at", "2020-01-02 19:46:24.220099"]]

Although minimum daily winter temperatures in the Arctic region and in the Brooks Range average â€“20Â°F (â€“29Â°C) and the ground at Point Barrow is frozen permanently to 1,330 ft (405 m), summer maximum daily temperatures in the Alaskan lowlands average above 60Â°F (16Â°C) and have been known to exceed 90Â°F (32Â°C). The southeastern region is moderate, ranging from a daily average of 30Â°F (â€“1Â°C) in January to 56Â°F (13Â°C) in July; the south-central zone has a similar summer range, but winters are somewhat harsher, especially in the interior. The Aleutian Islands have chilly, damp winters and rainy, foggy weather for most of the year; western Alaska is also rainy and cool. The all-time high for the state was 100Â°F (38Â°C), recorded at Ft. Yukon on 27 June 1915; the reading of â€“79.8Â°F (â€“62Â°C), registered at Prospect Creek Camp in the northwestern part of the state on 23 January 1971, is the lowest temperature ever officially recorded in the US.

Average yearly precipitation is approximately 45 in (114 cm) in the mountainous areas and greater in the lowlands; Little Rock received an annual average (1971â€“2000) of 50.9 in (129.2 cm), with an average relative humidity ranging from 84% at 7 AM to 57% at 1 PM.

Generally there are two seasonsâ€”a long, dry summer, with low humidity and cool evenings, and a mild, rainy winterâ€”except in the high mountains, where four seasons prevail and snow lasts from November to April. The one climatic constant for the state is summer drought. California has four main climatic regions. Mild summers and winters prevail in central coastal areas, where temperatures are more equable than virtually anywhere else in the US; in the area between San Francisco and Monterey, for example, the difference between average summer and winter temperatures is seldom more than 10Â°F (6Â°C). During the summer there are heavy fogs in San Francisco and all along the coast. Mountainous regions are characterized by milder summers and colder winters, with markedly low temperatures at high elevations. The Central Valley has hot summers and cool winters, while the Imperial Valley is marked by very hot, dry summers, with temperatures frequently exceeding 100Â°F (38Â°C). Average annual temperatures for the state range from 47Â°F (8Â°C) in the Sierra Nevada to 73Â°F (23Â°C) in the Imperial Valley. The highest temperature ever recorded in the US was 134Â° (57Â°C), registered in Death Valley on 10 July 1913. Death Valley has the hottest average summer temperature in the Western Hemisphere, at 98Â°F (37Â°C). The state's lowest temperature was â€“45Â°F (â€“43Â°C), recorded on 20 January 1937 at Boca, near the Nevada border. Among the major population centers, Los Angeles has an average annual temperature of 63Â°F (17Â°C), with an average January minimum of 48Â°F (9Â°C) and an average July maximum of 75Â°F (24Â°C). San Francisco has an annual average of 57Â°F (14Â°C), with a January average minimum of 42Â°F (6Â°C) and a July average maximum of 72Â°F (22Â°C). The annual average in San Diego is 64Â°F (18Â°C), the January average minimum 49Â°F (9Â°C), and the July average maximum 76Â°F (24Â°C). Sacramento's annual average temperature is 61Â°F (16Â°C), with January minimums averaging 38Â°F (3Â°C) and July maximums of 93Â°F (34Â°C). Annual precipitation varies from only 2 in (5 cm) in the Imperial Valley to 68 in (173 cm) at Blue Canyon, near Lake Tahoe. San Francisco had an average annual precipitation (1971â€“2000) of 20 in (51 cm), Sacramento 17.9 in (45.5 cm), Los Angeles 13.2 in (33.5 cm), and San Diego 10.8 in (27.4 cm). The largest one-month snowfall ever recorded in the USâ€”390 in (991 cm)â€”fell in Alpine County in January 1911. Snow averages between 300 and 400 in (760 to 1,020 cm) annually in the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada, but is rare in the coastal lowlands. Sacramento has the greatest percentage (73%) of possible annual sunshine among the state's largest cities; Los Angeles has 72% and San Francisco 71%. San Francisco is the windiest, with an average annual wind speed of 11 mph (18 km/hr).

Generally there are two seasonsâ€”a long, dry summer, with low humidity and cool evenings, and a mild, rainy winterâ€”except in the high mountains, where four seasons prevail and snow lasts from November to April. The one climatic constant for the state is summer drought. California has four main climatic regions. Mild summers and winters prevail in central coastal areas, where temperatures are more equable than virtually anywhere else in the US; in the area between San Francisco and Monterey, for example, the difference between average summer and winter temperatures is seldom more than 10Â°F (6Â°C). During the summer there are heavy fogs in San Francisco and all along the coast. Mountainous regions are characterized by milder summers and colder winters, with markedly low temperatures at high elevations. The Central Valley has hot summers and cool winters, while the Imperial Valley is marked by very hot, dry summers, with temperatures frequently exceeding 100Â°F (38Â°C). Average annual temperatures for the state range from 47Â°F (8Â°C) in the Sierra Nevada to 73Â°F (23Â°C) in the Imperial Valley. The highest temperature ever recorded in the US was 134Â° (57Â°C), registered in Death Valley on 10 July 1913. Death Valley has the hottest average summer temperature in the Western Hemisphere, at 98Â°F (37Â°C).
