alabama = Location.create(name: "Alabama", climate: "Alabama's three climatic divisions are the lower coastal plain, largely subtropical and strongly influenced by the Gulf of Mexico; the northern plateau, marked by occasional snowfall in winter; and the Black Belt and upper coastal plain, lying between the two extremes. Among the major population centers, Birmingham has an annual mean temperature of 62°F (17°C), with a normal July daily maximum of 90°F (32°C) and a normal January daily minimum of 34°F (1°C). Montgomery has an annual mean of 65°F (18°C), with a normal July daily maximum of 91°F (33°C) and a normal January daily minimum of 37°F (3°C). The mean in Mobile is 67°F (19°C), with a normal July daily maximum of 91°F (33°C) and a normal January daily minimum of 41°F (51°C). The record low temperature for the state is –27°F (–33°C), registered at New Market, in the northeastern corner, on 30 January 1966; the all-time high is 112°F (44°C), registered at Centerville, in the state's midsection, on 5 September 1925. Mobile, one of the rainiest cities in the United States, recorded an average precipitation of 66.3 in (168 cm) a year between 1971 and 2000.")
alaska = Location.create(name: "Alaska", climate: "Americans, who called Alaska 'Seward's icebox' when it was first purchased from the Russians, were unaware of the variety of climatic conditions within its six topographic regions. Although minimum daily winter temperatures in the Arctic region and in the Brooks Range average –20°F (–29°C) and the ground at Point Barrow is frozen permanently to 1,330 ft (405 m), summer maximum daily temperatures in the Alaskan lowlands average above 60°F (16°C) and have been known to exceed 90°F (32°C). The southeastern region is moderate, ranging from a daily average of 30°F (–1°C) in January to 56°F (13°C) in July; the south-central zone has a similar summer range, but winters are somewhat harsher, especially in the interior. The Aleutian Islands have chilly, damp winters and rainy, foggy weather for most of the year; western Alaska is also rainy and cool. The all-time high for the state was 100°F (38°C), recorded at Ft. Yukon on 27 June 1915; the reading of –79.8°F (–62°C), registered at Prospect Creek Camp in the northwestern part of the state on 23 January 1971, is the lowest temperature ever officially recorded in the US. Juneau received an annual average precipitation of 58.3 in (148 cm), with 98.5 in (250 cm) of snowfall recorded at the airport there each year. The entire southeastern region of Alaska has a wide range of microclimates with varying levels of precipitation; Juneau's metropolitan area precipitation ranges from 40 in (102 cm) to over 100 in (254 cm) per year.")
arizona = Location.create(name: "Arizona", climate: "Arizona has a dry climate, with little rainfall. Temperatures vary greatly from place to place, season to season, and day to night. Average daily temperatures at Yuma, in the southwestern desert range from 43° to 67°F (6° to 19°C) in January, and from 81° to 106°F (27° to 41°C) in July. At Flagstaff, in the interior uplands, average daily January temperatures range from 14° to 41°F (–10° to 5°C), and average daily July temperatures range from 50° to 81°F (10° to 27°C). The maximum recorded temperature was 128°F (53°C), registered at Lake Havasu City on 29 June 1994; the minimum, –40°F (–40°C), was set at Hawley Lake on 7 January 1971. The highest elevations of the state, running diagonally from the southeast to the northwest, receive between 25 and 30 in (63 to 76 cm) of precipitation a year, and the rest, for the most part, between 7 and 20 in (18 to 51 cm). Average annual precipitation at Phoenix (1971–2000) was 8.3 in (21 cm). The driest area is the extreme southwest, which receives less than 3 in (8 cm) a year. Snow, sometimes as much as 100 in (254 cm), falls on the highest peaks each winter but is rare in the southern and western lowlands. The greatest amount of sunshine is registered in the southwest, with the proportion decreasing progressively toward the northeast; overall, the state receives more than 80% of possible sunshine, among the highest in the US, and Phoenix's 86% is higher than that of any other major US city.")
new_hampshire = Location.create(name: "New Hampshire", climate: "New Hampshire has a changeable climate, with wide variations in daily and seasonal temperatures. Summers are short and cool, winters long and cold. Concord has a normal daily mean temperature of 46°F (8°C), ranging from 21°F (–6°C) in January to 70°F (21°C) in July. The record low temperature, –46°F (–43°C), was set at Pittsburg on 28 January 1925; the all-time high, 106°F (41°C) at Nashua, 4 July 1911. Annual precipitation at Concord (1971–2000) averaged 37.6 in (95.5 cm); the average snowfall in Concord is 65 in (165 cm) a year, with more than 100 in (254 cm) yearly in the mountains. The strongest wind ever recorded, other than during a tornado—231 mph (372 kph)—occurred on Mt. Washington on 12 April 1934.")
arkansas = Location.create(name: "Arkansas", climate: "Arkansas has a temperate climate, warmer and more humid in the southern lowlands than in the mountainous regions. At Little Rock, the normal daily temperature ranges from 40°F (4°C) in January to 81°F (27°C) in July. A record low of –29°F (–34°C) was set on 13 February 1905 at the Pond weather station, and a record high of 120°F (49°C) was recorded on 10 August 1936 at the Ozark station. Average yearly precipitation is approximately 45 in (114 cm) in the mountainous areas and greater in the lowlands; Little Rock received an annual average (1971–2000) of 50.9 in (129.2 cm), with an average relative humidity ranging from 84% at 7 AM to 57% at 1 PM. Snowfall in the capital averages 5.2 in (13.2 cm) a year.")
california = Location.create(name: "California", climate: "Like its topography, California's climate is varied and tends toward extremes. Generally there are two seasons—a long, dry summer, with low humidity and cool evenings, and a mild, rainy winter—except in the high mountains, where four seasons prevail and snow lasts from November to April. The one climatic constant for the state is summer drought. California has four main climatic regions. Mild summers and winters prevail in central coastal areas, where temperatures are more equable than virtually anywhere else in the US; in the area between San Francisco and Monterey, for example, the difference between average summer and winter temperatures is seldom more than 10°F (6°C). During the summer there are heavy fogs in San Francisco and all along the coast. Mountainous regions are characterized by milder summers and colder winters, with markedly low temperatures at high elevations. The Central Valley has hot summers and cool winters, while the Imperial Valley is marked by very hot, dry summers, with temperatures frequently exceeding 100°F (38°C). Average annual temperatures for the state range from 47°F (8°C) in the Sierra Nevada to 73°F (23°C) in the Imperial Valley. The highest temperature ever recorded in the US was 134° (57°C), registered in Death Valley on 10 July 1913. Death Valley has the hottest average summer temperature in the Western Hemisphere, at 98°F (37°C). The state's lowest temperature was –45°F (–43°C), recorded on 20 January 1937 at Boca, near the Nevada border. Among the major population centers, Los Angeles has an average annual temperature of 63°F (17°C), with an average January minimum of 48°F (9°C) and an average July maximum of 75°F (24°C). San Francisco has an annual average of 57°F (14°C), with a January average minimum of 42°F (6°C) and a July average maximum of 72°F (22°C). The annual average in San Diego is 64°F (18°C), the January average minimum 49°F (9°C), and the July average maximum 76°F (24°C). Sacramento's annual average temperature is 61°F (16°C), with January minimums averaging 38°F (3°C) and July maximums of 93°F (34°C). Annual precipitation varies from only 2 in (5 cm) in the Imperial Valley to 68 in (173 cm) at Blue Canyon, near Lake Tahoe. San Francisco had an average annual precipitation (1971–2000) of 20 in (51 cm), Sacramento 17.9 in (45.5 cm), Los Angeles 13.2 in (33.5 cm), and San Diego 10.8 in (27.4 cm). The largest one-month snowfall ever recorded in the US—390 in (991 cm)—fell in Alpine County in January 1911. Snow averages between 300 and 400 in (760 to 1,020 cm) annually in the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada, but is rare in the coastal lowlands. Sacramento has the greatest percentage (73%) of possible annual sunshine among the state's largest cities; Los Angeles has 72% and San Francisco 71%. San Francisco is the windiest, with an average annual wind speed of 11 mph (18 km/hr). Tropical rainstorms occur often in California during the winter.")
